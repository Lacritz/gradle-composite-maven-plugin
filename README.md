# MavenPublishCompositionPlugin
This project is meant to be an example of developing plugin compositions with
 gradle. Gradle has a straight forward way to develop those composition 
 plugins, but sometimes, especially whenever default configuration of 
 extensions are necessary - the development may struggle a bit. 
 
 ## Get Started
 ### Open Project
 #### Intellij
 To open Intellij just type the following:
 ```bash
 gradle openIdea
 ```
 _Note: Having Intellij as standard application to open .idea files is 
 mandatory_ 

### Upload Plugin
#### Local
 To publish the plugin to your local maven repository you can use the following:
 ```bash
 gradle publishPluginMavenPublicationToMavenLocal
 ```
